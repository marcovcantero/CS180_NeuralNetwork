# CS180 Neural Network
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with GloVe word embeddings to predict Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations from textual data. The work explores a deep learning approach to Natural Language Processing (NLP) without relying on transformer-based architectures.
